# UN-Data

Created in Windows 10
Python 3.90 (Need python 3 or above)

Just make sure python3 is installed correctly.

or
simply click on the python executable.

Note: May recieve a warning regarding embedded key registration; allow the process to go through as that is just a warning from the app using BeautifulSoup to communicate with the UN url.

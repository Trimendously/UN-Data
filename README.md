# UN-Data

Created in Windows 10
Python 3.90 ( Need python 3 or above)

To run make sure Pandas, BeautifulSoup, tkinter, and numpy are up to date.

Windows: 
        pip install pandas
        pip install BeautifulSoup
        pip install tkinter
        pip install numpy

Then run on windows command line/ terminal python un.py
or
simply click on the python executable.

Note: May recieve a warning regarding embedded key registration; allow the process to go through as that is just a warning from the app using BeautifulSoup to communicate with the UN url.
